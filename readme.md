# CS534 - HW6

The Homework 6 assignment for WPI's Spring 2019 CS534 - AI course.
The goal is to explore Artificial Neural Networks and Decision Trees, using
an existing dataset to train with. This project uses Keras for the ANN, and 
Scikit-Learn for Decision Trees.

data_object.py contains the classes used to structure the data
images.npy contains the np export of the image data
labels.npy contains the np export of the label data
train_model.hw6 contains the export of the trained Keras model
output.txt contains the relevant output of the script
## Instructions

This was built using Keras and Tensorflow version only compatible with Python 3.6.2.
Please use this version of python to run the script.

To run this program, and ensure you use your python 3.6.2 environment run the command
`py -3.6 homework6.py`
which takes advantage of the python launcher "py"
or if python 3.6 is the only version of python in your path,
`python homework6.py`
